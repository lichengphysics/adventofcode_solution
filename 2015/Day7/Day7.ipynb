    "# Day 7: Some Assembly Required \n",
    "This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: `x AND y -> z` means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire z.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`123 -> x` means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.\n",
    "`x AND y -> z` means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.\n",
    "\n",
    "`p LSHIFT 2 -> q` means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.\n",
    "\n",
    "`NOT e -> f` means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible gates include `OR` (bitwise OR) and `RSHIFT` (right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a simple circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "123 -> x\n",
    "456 -> y\n",
    "x AND y -> d\n",
    "x OR y -> e\n",
    "x LSHIFT 2 -> f\n",
    "y RSHIFT 2 -> g\n",
    "NOT x -> h\n",
    "NOT y -> i\n",
    "```\n",
    "After it is run, these are the signals on the wires:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "d: 72\n",
    "e: 507\n",
    "f: 492\n",
    "g: 114\n",
    "h: 65412\n",
    "i: 65079\n",
    "x: 123\n",
    "y: 456\n",
    "```\n",
    "In little Bobby's kit's instructions booklet (provided as your puzzle input), what signal is ultimately provided to wire a?"
